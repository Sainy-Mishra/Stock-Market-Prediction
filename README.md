# Stock Market Prediction

The Stock Market Prediction project leverages machine learning to forecast stock prices based on historical data. By utilizing advanced predictive models, the project aims to assist traders and investors in making informed decisions. This tool is designed to handle large datasets efficiently and provide meaningful insights into stock price movements.

## Features
* Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and splits it into training and testing sets.
* Machine Learning Models: Utilizes algorithms like Linear Regression, LSTM, and Random Forest for accurate predictions.
* Visualization: Graphs and charts for analyzing trends and model performance.
